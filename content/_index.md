    <h2 class="c-heading">Update</h2>
    <p> We have decided to stop working on the Open Communications Alliance and are no longer an active community. The decision to no longer try to build the community was made because of a lack of resources and interest. We still believe that talking about and helping each other with the different communication-related projects in the open source space is important, but right now we canâ€™t devote the time needed to really get an Open Source community started. Signed, Ruben and Ashley, founding members of the Open Communications Alliance.</p>
