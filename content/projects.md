      <p>This project is a JavaScript library developed to make developing applications for calling in the browser easier. It is built upon the popular <a href="https://sipjs.com/" rel="external" target="_blank">SIP.js</a> library that allows working with the SIP protocol in the browser. The WebphoneLib adds a layer of abstraction that allows developers to not worry about SIP events, REGISTER’s, INVITE’s and the like.</p>
      <p>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/open-voip-alliance/WebphoneLib/" rel="external" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a> for the library or check out <a href="https://discourse.openvoipalliance.org/t/develop-voip-software-for-the-browser-using-webphonelib/40" rel="external" target="_blank">the forum</a> to join the conversation about the project!</p>

      </h3>
      <p>
        <a href="https://ca11.app" target="_blank">CA11</a> started in 2019 with the purpose to make telephony more like the Web;
          accessible and without the need for accounts or subscriptions. CA11 consists of a WebRTC softphone with flexible support for
          multiple signalling protocols. It currently implements the SIP protocol and a custom protocol called SIG11.
          SIP is oriented towards calling with an intermediary PBX(Asterisk); SIG11 is developed to accomodate P2P calling.
          The CA11 project generally focusses on the following themes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Privacy - Calls (SIP/SIG11) and Signalling (SIG11) should be E2E encrypted</li>
        <li>Accessibility - Open accountless signalling service (SIG11)</li>
        <li>Synergy - Integrate with existing telephony systems (SIP)</li>
        <li>Costs - Decentralized media (SIG11)</li>
      </ul>
